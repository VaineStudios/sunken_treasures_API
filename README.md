# MONGO_EXPRESS_API Template

## Description
This is a template repository that can be used to easily generate a boilerplate repository and application using MongoDB and Express to create a RESTFUL API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- An Account with AWS that will be used to store images
- An App Password from Gmail to be used to set up your email in nodemailer
- A Mongodb Cluster (Preferably MongoDB Atlas)
- Node and NPM to install packages

### Using Repository as a Template.
To do this you need to visit the code tab of the repository. A button will appear on the page, beside the 'code' dropdown button which is labeled template. Once you click on the button, follow the instructions to create a repository from the template.

### Installing
In order to do this, you need to run the command `npm install` or `npm i` this will install all dependencies for the project. Once this is done, run the command `npm run start`, to start the application. If you wish to use the app in develop mode, restarting the server as soon as changes are made to the files, use the command `npm run debug` which will use *nodemon* to run the application instead.
